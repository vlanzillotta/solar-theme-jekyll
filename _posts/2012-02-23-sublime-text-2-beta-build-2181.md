Today [Jon Skinner][1] released [build 2181 of the Sublime Text 2 Beta][2]. It seems like every update adds a feature that I was previously getting from a third party package. In this case the option to highlight every instance of the currently selected word.

At some point I hope to write up all the reasons I&#8217;m loving Sublime Text 2. In the mean time I&#8217;ll just say that if you&#8217;re looking for a great text editor, you should at least give the [demo][3] a try.
