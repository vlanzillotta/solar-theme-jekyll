Sometimes it feels like being happy with a wireless keyboard means being happy with its few benefits and content to deal with its many compromises. These compromises may include having to deal with batteries, a lack of usb ports, or a less than full key set (and this is just to name a few). Where the [Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard][1] shines for me is that it eliminated my most hated compromises, leaving only the few that I have little to no concern over. 

## The Battery

The main reason I&#8217;ve stuck with wired keyboards for so long is because it meant not having to deal with batteries. Even if it meant having an ugly wire running down the center of my desk, I&#8217;d rather not have to stress over whether I had 80% or 10% charge left on my keyboard. The Logitech Solar Keyboard finds a way to offer the best of both worlds. Instead of replaceable batteries the Logitech Solar Keyboard has a built in solar charged lithium ion battery. This battery is charged through two solar panels above the function keys. These panels certainly don&#8217;t help the keyboard asthetically, but offer the simplest solution for anyone who doesn&#8217;t want to deal with wires or batteries.

Of course, solar panels are not a solution for everyone. If you use a keyboard tray that hides under your desk, or if you work in a room with no windows, this keyboard is not for you. Fortunately, my home office has a very large window and my keyboard sits on my desk where it can collect sunlight all day. As a result, I have not seen the charge on the battery drop below 98% &#8211; even on overcast or rainy days.

# The Keys

You would think that having the right keys on a keyboard would be the first thing most companies get right. However, it amazes me just how many wireless keyboards lack any keys east of *backspace*. The Logitech Solar Keyboard doesn&#8217;t make these omissions, containing all numberpad and navigation keys. Perhaps for most people these keys are useless, but as a developer I am constantly using forward delete as well as moving to the beginning or end of a line with the HOME and END keys. I also much prefer using a number pad instead of having to navigate the entire length of the keyboard to use the number row.

The Logitech Solar Keyboard is also available in the Apple style keyboard layout. In this layout, the command key takes the place of the Windows key and is located next to the spacebar. In OS X the command key is used much more than alt or control, so having it closer to my thumb is a huge benefit.

## The Feel

So far, in my opinion, nothing can match the sturdiness and stability found in Apple&#8217;s Unibody Keyboards. Logitech did a great job coming close to the build quality found in Apple keyboards, but this keyboard simply cannot match the feel of a solid piece of aluminum. That being said, it does feel great. While it doesn&#8217;t feel like a solid piece of metal, it also doesn&#8217;t feel hollow or cheap either.

Logitech also took many design cues from Apple. The keyboard design is meant to be as close to the Apple Extended Keyboard as possible and succeeds both in look and feel. This keyboard feels like an Apple device. The keys feel a bit softer but are *clicky* enough to make sure you know you committed a keystroke.

One way the Logitech Solar Keyboard beats its Apple counterparts hands down is the fact that it can lay flat. If you type a lot like I do, ergonomics become important and having to arch your wrist up for long periods of typing is a quick path to repetitive stress injury. The solar keyboard does include two small feet which can be pulled out to raise the back up about an inch, but these feel very flimsey and take away from the solid, sturdy feel of the keyboard.

# Summery

No one keyboard can be perfect for everyone, but The Logitech Wireless Solar Keyboard comes pretty close for me. Many people may still prefer the tactile feel of a classic (non-chicklet) style keyboard. Other people may not be able to part with the built in USB ports that come with many wired keyboards today. But if your priorities and situation match mine, then I can&#8217;t think of a better solution.
