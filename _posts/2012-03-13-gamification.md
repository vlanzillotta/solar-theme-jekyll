Griffin McElroy quoting Bing Gordon on [running your company like a World of Warcraft guild][1]:

> &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to build a company, you have to do it like a World of Warcraft guild leader builds guilds,&#8221; Gordon explained. &#8220;You build a weekly calendar, with check-ins, you come up with a system and process to split up the loot, and hope that they don&#8217;t try to kill the boss,&#8221; he joked.

I&#8217;ve been an on again off again World of Warcraft player for many years now. During these years, there was always a direct relationship between how much WOW I played and how satisfied I was with my job. During the most boring times (where I had few responsibilities and my actions had little to no impact), I would play from when I got home at 6:00 until I went to bed.

I worked with my guild to build a schedule where people could make appointments (raids) and I helped to assign who would be needed and when. As a result, I became a higher ranking member of the guild with more privileges &#8211; and responsibilities. Once I left my job and moved on to a place where I felt my contributions mattered, my playtime took a sharp drop and I went from 6 hours a night to less than 3 hours a week.

What games like WOW do (and what many companies would be smart to pick up on) is to give their users many short term goals. They can offer modest rewards if these goals are met, but with a dedicated team the reward can often be the completion of the goal itself. Oftentimes, the loot obtained after killing a new WOW boss was far less exciting than the fact that the team achieved their goal.

Many days, when my workload is high, I will open my text editor of choice and write &#8220;0/X&#8221; &#8211; X being the number of tasks I have ahead of me. After I complete my first task, I change it to &#8220;1/X&#8221; and so on. If I get all my tasks done, I&#8217;ve achieved my goal. If five more items come in after completing 4 tasks, even though my task list actually grew instead of shrinking, I can still see that I have those 4 items done and I know that I&#8217;m still being productive.

Another good example:

> Principle Skinner: Oh, licking envelopes can be fun! All you have to do is make a game of it.
> 
> Bart: What kind of game?
> 
> Principle Skinner: Well, for example, you could see how many you could lick in an hour, then try to break that record.
> 
> Bart: Sounds like a pretty crappy game to me.
> 
> Principle Skinner: Yes, well&#8230; Get started.

&#8220;Gamification&#8221; is the recognition of short term achievements to guide you to a long term goal. It could be an employee of the month award or a personal goal you set for yourself each day. Either way, it&#8217;s a great way to keep your head in the game (no pun intended).
