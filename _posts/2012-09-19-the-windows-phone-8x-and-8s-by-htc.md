I really like the look of [the Windows Phone 8X and 8S by HTC][1]. These phones are colourful &#8211; really colourful &#8211; and they&#8217;re not afraid to show it off. This is a great way for them to distinguish themselves from the iPhone, a product which has become so minimalistic and easy on the eyes that you almost get the impression it wants to be invisible.

As [John Gruber][2] points out, these phones look nothing like their Android running kin and fall more in-line with Nokia&#8217;s Lumina series. I assume this is because of Windows Phone 8&#8217;s strong design language. The bold nature of the metro (err sorry &#8220;Modern UI&#8221;) layout almost demands that the hardware encasing it conforms to that particular style to have a unified experience. Compare this to the anything-goes nature of Android where the hardware has to be generic (and usually forgettable) because it has no clue how the information on the screen is going to be styled.

I can&#8217;t speak for the software experience, or how these phones feel in the hand, but as long as both Microsoft and HTC continue to make bold decisions and stick to their guns, things are looking really promising for both of them.
