I&#8217;ve been slowly working my way through the [Standford University IOS development course on iTunes U][1]. The first 3 assignments build off each other and the final result is a programmable graphic calculator.

While it works fine, I&#8217;m not a huge fan of the syntax required for inputing a formula. For example: to enter 3 * 5 you have to press `3, ENTER, 5, *`. I&#8217;ve never had to work with this type of syntax, but I also never really had to use a programmable calculator before.

Either way, [here][2] is the final result. A bit rough around the edges, but a decent jump into IOS development.
